            Join us as we gather together our collective love of this ecological and historical gem to counter the development proposal. Together we can find a better and more sustainable solution that meets the needs of all, including; the Galilee Center, a respected retreat center that has been entrusted with the care of this land for many years; the townâ€™s folk who live nearby or use this area for their physical and spiritual wellbeing; the flora, fauna and fungi of the great and incredibly rare forest known as Gillies Grove; and the developer who needs to find ways to build homes for a growing Ontario population.
          <br /><br />
            Together we can find a better way!
